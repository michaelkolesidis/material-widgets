# Material Widgets

A collection of ecological material widgets.

## Description

_TypeScript_ has been used as the main programming language, providing a robust foundation for enforcing type safety throughout the codebase. The user interface is created using _React_ along with _MUI_ (Material UI), a versatile component library.

To manage the application's state in a predictable and efficient manner, a combination of _Zustand_ and _Immer_ has been used. _Zustand_ allows the creation of an immutable global state, serving as a single source of truth for the application. _Immer_ enhances the state management process by enabling the creation of immutable data structures in a more intuitive and concise manner.

The rendering process is characterized by a unidirectional flow of data. As data is fetched from the external API, it is saved into the global immutable state. This ensures that the application maintains a consistent and synchronized representation of the data across all components. The widget components receive their properties and settings from this global state. When a change in settings occurs within a widget component, the global state is updated first. Subsequently, this modification triggers the re-rendering of the affected widget, allowing it to seamlessly reflect the latest changes. This synchronous relationship between the global state and the widget components ensures a responsive and up-to-date user interface.

In summary, the use of _TypeScript_, _React_ with _MUI_, _Zustand_, and _Immer_ collectively contributes to a scalable, maintainable, and type-safe architecture. The global immutable state acts as a cornerstone, facilitating seamless communication between components and enabling a dynamic user experience that effortlessly adapts to evolving data and user interactions.
